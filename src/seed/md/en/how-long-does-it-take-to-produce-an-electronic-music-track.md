Creating an electronic music track is a creative journey that can take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the level of detail, the producer’s experience, and the musical style. Whether it’s **House, Techno, Trance, Psytrance, or Progressive**, each genre has unique characteristics that influence the process and timeline of production.

## 🧠 1. Structure Design: The Skeleton of Your Track (2–6 hours)

Before playing a single note, many producers start by designing the **overall structure** of the track. This serves as a map that guides the energy of the song.

A typical structure might look like this:

Intro → Build → Break → Drop → Break → Bridge → Drop → Outro

Some producers use **empty MIDI clips** as placeholders to visualize where each section will go. This helps with composition and ensures a logical flow. Depending on the genre:

- **House:** may have a long intro and subtle grooves.
- **Techno:** often more repetitive, with small changes every bar.
- **Psytrance:** uses longer builds and more spacious drops.

⏱️ Estimated time: 2 to 6 hours.

## 🎛️ 2. Sound Design: Building Your Palette (6–20 hours)

Once the structure is set, it’s time for sound design:

- **Kick:** strong, defined, genre-appropriate.
- **Bassline:** deep, punchy, rhythmic.
- **Synths and Leads:** melodic or hypnotic, depending on style.
- **Vocals or FX:** add texture or narrative.

Sounds are created or selected using **synthesis, resampling, or sample libraries**. This can be an obsessive process, as many artists seek a unique sonic identity.

🎧 Example: Astrix has mentioned it can take **over a week** just to find the right kick and bass for a track.

⏱️ Estimated time: 6 to 20 hours (sometimes more).

## 🎹 3. Composition: Bringing the Piano Roll to Life (4–12 hours)

With the sounds ready, it’s time to **compose melodies, rhythms, and harmonic progressions**. This stage defines:

- The groove of the bass and drums.
- Main melodies.
- Fills and variations.

Everything is drawn into the **piano roll** using MIDI notes. Vocal ideas might also be recorded, or rhythmic samples added.

⏱️ Estimated time: 4 to 12 hours.

## 🎚️ 4. Automation and FX: The Soul in Motion (3–10 hours)

A flat song won’t move anyone. This is where **filters, reverbs, delays, and other effects** come in:

- **Filter sweeps** for smooth transitions.
- **Automation of volume and FX** to build tension or release energy.
- **Tempo, pitch, or texture changes** to keep things interesting.

Automation transforms a static loop into a dynamic journey.

⏱️ Estimated time: 3 to 10 hours.

## 🍓 5. Details and FX: The Icing on the Cake (2–6 hours)

This is the moment to **add special details**, like:

- **Reverse crashes**, glitches, white noise.
- **Small rhythmic fills**, unexpected hits.
- Ambient sounds or vocal chops.

Think of it as decorating a cake: **the icing, strawberries, and chocolate ribbon.** Not essential, but unforgettable.

⏱️ Estimated time: 2 to 6 hours.

## 🎧 6. Mixing and Final Distribution Format (4–16 hours)

Finally, it's time to **balance all the elements**:

- Leveling volumes.
- Placing each instrument in its space (panning, EQ).
- Using compression and saturation to add character.

Instead of using the term “master,” some prefer to call it the **final production and distribution format**, to avoid the historical weight of the term.

The final file should sound good on **clubs, radios, and streaming platforms**.

## ⏳ Total Estimated Time

| Stage | Approximate Time |
| --- | --- |
| **Sound Design** | 6 – 20 hours |
| **MIDI Composition** | 4 – 12 hours |
| **Automation and FX** | 3 – 10 hours |
| **Details and FX** | 2 – 6 hours |
| **Mixing and Distribution** | 4 – 16 hours |
| ⏱️ **Total:** | 21 to 70 hours |

🎶 Some producers like **Astrix, Boris Brejcha, or Deadmau5** can spend **weeks or even months** finishing a single track, depending on their level of perfectionism.

## ✅ Final Tips

- **Don’t get frustrated** if a track takes you weeks. It’s completely normal.
- **Save presets and templates** to save time in future productions.
- **Rest your ears!** Take a break every hour-long session.
- **De-stress!** Exercise, watch a movie, take a walk.  
  When ideas don’t flow, do something different—when you return, inspiration might too.
- **Enjoy the process.** Every session is a chance to learn and grow.
