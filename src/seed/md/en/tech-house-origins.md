**Tech House** emerged in the mid-90s as a middle ground between two worlds: the **danceable groove of House** and the **minimalist energy of Techno**. Although its roots trace back to cities like **Chicago and New York**, it was in **London** where this subgenre found its true identity.

## 🧬 Who Started Tech House?

Several DJs and producers helped define this sound:

- **Mr. C** (founder of *The End* club, London)  
- **Terry Francis** (resident at *The End*)  
- **Nathan Coles**  
- **Eddie Richards**  
- **Pure Science**, **Dave Angel**, among others.

Labels like **Wiggle**, **20/20 Vision**, **Surreal**, and clubs like **Fabric** and **Turnmills** were key to its spread.

## 🧪 Key Elements of Classic Tech House

- **BPM**: between **120 and 128**, maintaining a mid-tempo pace.
- **Rhythm section**: 4x4 pattern with subtle hi-hats and minimal percussion.
- **Basslines**: deep, rounded, and groovy.
- **Melodies**: sparse or very subtle, focused more on atmosphere than harmony.
- **Style**: clean, progressive, with effects like delay, reverb, and filters.

> 🔊 The focus isn't on impact, but on a **progressive journey**, a constant groove.

## 🤖 Why Is It Called Tech House?

The name is literally a fusion:

- **"Tech"** for its Techno influences: repetitive structures, synthetic sounds, dark atmospheres.
- **"House"** for its rhythmic and danceable roots: funky basslines, catchy patterns, and organic percussion.

The result is a **minimalistic yet highly danceable** style.

## 🔄 Why Does Modern Tech House Sound So Different?

Starting in **2016**, Tech House began to shift:

- It became more **commercial and festival-oriented**.
- Use of **drops**, **vocal chops**, and **distorted basslines** (influenced by EDM and Bass House).
- Less groove, more immediate impact.

> Today, what many call “Tech House” is more of a blend of **EDM, Bass House, and G-House**, far from the original roots.

## 🧠 Conclusion

The **original Tech House** was an elegant, hypnotic genre with an emphasis on groove and subtle progression. What we hear today at major festivals is something else: more aggressive, more commercial, and for many —myself included— no longer truly Tech House.

Still, it **remains alive in the underground**, in labels and artists who continue to value that minimalist, tribal, immersive 90s sound.
